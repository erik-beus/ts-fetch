# ts-fetch

Small wrapper around `fetch` making it possible to have type safety around network requests.
By passing generics it's possible to indicate which types are expected on success/error and work directly with those types.

## Example usages
### Basic request with no arguments
```
const response = await request<{name: string}, {errorCode: number}>({
  url: 'https://myapi.com'
})
if (response.success) {
  // Work with response.data in a typesafe way üëç
}
```
### Request with custom arguments and a non-JSON response
```
const response = await request<never, { errorCode: number }>({
  url: 'https://myapi.com',
  body: { name: 'Updated name of user' },
  method: 'PUT',
  jsonResponse: false, // Response will not be in JSON
  timeout: 1000, // Only 1 second timeout
  validStatusCodes: [201], // Only 201 indicates success
  extraHeaders: [{ key: 'Secret', value: '2lknf3oihvls' }],
})
if (response.success) {
  // Things went well üëç
} else if (response.networkError) {
  // Handle network error
} else {
  // Work with the returned error data that you expect in your response
}
```
